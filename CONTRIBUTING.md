# Contributing to ember-cli-mapbox

We really appreciate contributions to ember-cli-mapbox.

If you're implementing a new feature, please add some documentation to the `README.md`
to explain how to use your feature as part of the pull request.

Apologies for the lack of tests, please add tests to accompany pull requests if you can.
At least make sure the the test suite passes, Circle CI will tell you otherwise, some of
the tests are there to ensure a [consistent code style](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-suave).
